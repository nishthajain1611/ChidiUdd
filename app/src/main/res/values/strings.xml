    <string name="how_to_play">For every object displayed on the screen, answer whether it flies or not.\n\n
        Swipe UP fast to answer \'fly\'.\n\n
        Swipe DOWN fast to answer \'does not fly\'.\n\n
        But here is the twist.
        Not every object mentioned is a subject to this question.
        So if you think the thing \'can\' fly, it flies.\n\n
        Beware!! If you press back button, you lose your score.
